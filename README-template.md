### What I learned

I learnt how to center images using display block and margin which is easier. Making use of flexbox can really make a difference in your styling techniques. Making use of line height and letter spacing can really make your headings and paragraphs stand out and not look so busy.

Working on your HTML first, while working top to bottom can helpl keep your tags in order. It helped me to also label everything, including the sections so i know where i am at in the process.


### Continued development

I definitely want to focus on writing clean code which I could add to at anytime.
I'd like to focus on getting into JS and react, so i can build bigger and user friendly website/Applications.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me with CSS positioning and flexbox. I really liked how simple they made it and will use it going forward.
